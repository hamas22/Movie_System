## üöÄ The Refactoring Story

The original version of this project was built with legacy technologies and had a static design that wasn't suitable for modern devices. The goal of the refactoring process was to:
1.  **Modernize the Look & Feel:** Transition to a contemporary UI using pre-built Bootstrap components.
2.  **Achieve Full Responsiveness:** Ensure the website works flawlessly across all screen sizes.
3.  **Improve Code Quality:** Apply best practices for HTML and CSS to make the code more scalable and maintainable.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For structuring the web pages.
-   **CSS3:** For custom styling and design.
-   **Bootstrap 5:** The core framework for layout, components, and responsiveness.
-   **JavaScript:** [Mention if you used any JS for interactivity. If not, you can remove this line].
